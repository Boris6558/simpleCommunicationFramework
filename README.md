# simpleCommunicationFramework
 简单通信框架
 
 客户端采用Qt框架，服务端采用异步机制，两端通信基于boost.asio，通过协议进行传输
 只提供最基本框架，这个框架稍加修改可以可以应用于C/S架构的项目。
 服务端测试并发数目前只测了10万左右，应该还可以更多
 
 A simple communication framework
 
Clients use the Qt framework, the service side uses asynchronous mechanism, both ends of communication based on boss.asio, through the protocol transmission
 Only the most basic framework is provided, which can be applied to C/S schema projects with slight modifications.
 The number of service-side tests has only been measured at about 100,000, and there should be more
